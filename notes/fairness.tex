  The problem of fairness in machine learning and artificial intelligence has only recently been widely recognised. When any algorithm is implemented at scale, no matter the original objective and whether it is satisfied, it has significant societal effects. In particular, even when considering the narrow objective of the algorithm, even if it improves it overall, it may increase inequality.

  In this course we will look at two aspects of fairness. The first has to do with disadvantaged populations that form distinct social classes due to a shared income stratum, race or gender. The second has to do with meritocratic notions of fairness.

  \frametitle{Bail decisions}
  \only<article>{
    For our example regarding disadvantaged populations, consider the example of bail decisions in the US court system. When a defendant is charged, the judge has the option to either place them in jail pending trial, or set them free, under the condition that the defendant pays some amount of bail. The amount of bail (if any) is set to an amount that would be expected to deter flight or a relapse.

  How can we explain this discrepancy? We can show that in fact, each one of these different measures of bias in our decision rules can be seen as a notion of conditional independence.
