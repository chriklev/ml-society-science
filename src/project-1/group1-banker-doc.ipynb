    "# Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is it possible to ensure that the policy maximises revenue?\n",
    "We cannot ensure with 100 % certainty that the policy maximises revenue. This is due to the fact that the model is not perfect and we are maximising the expected utility. There is an uncertainty in the estimated probability of a new individual being credit-worthy. If there were no uncertainty in this and we knew in advance which of the new individuals were going to pay back, we could ensure that a policy would maximise revenue by only lending to the credit-worthy individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can we take into account the uncertainty due to limited/biased data?\n",
    "In an ideal world we would have an independent replication of our study and check whether or not new, independent data would develop the same type of policy that we obtained with the current data set. Another option is simulation of data in order to validate our policy based on constructed data (Dimitrakakis, 2020, pp. 35-36). When it comes to the current policy, there are several ways of taking this uncertainty into account when considering our objective of maximising expected utility.\n",
